Hi,

1) Import the project into eclipse.
2) Please run the file ChessClient.java which starts playing automatically to the ease of evaluation.

If you wanted to play with AI please go ChessClient.java and to the line numbers 76-83 to play accordingly upon your interest.

Make the value of runBook in AlphaBetaAlgorithm.java to “true” to use the good moves in the start of the play.

For all the details regarding the extra credits please refer to the report, where I provided a clear information on bonus points. For efficiency I modified the code in the stub slightly which, I mentioned in the report.

contact me if you face trouble in executing the project.

Thanks,
Mahesh.
